# My system's configuration files

## Todos for the my config

## Neovim
* Make it look good and it should be fast
* Features that are must for me
    - [x] a good code completion frame work (be it lsp or some other thing)
    - [x] fast and easy file navigation
    - [x] fast naviation between the the buffers
    - [x] good colorscheme 
    ### Some candidates for colorschemes are (based on my preferences)
    - [x] **[solorized-osaka](https://github.com/craftzdog/solarized-osaka.nvim)** One of the Solarized-inspired dark theme for Neovim written in Lua.

    `Im satisfied with these two themes for now ;-)`

* Features that would be a good to have
    - [x] git integration
    - [x] icon's support

## Tmux
- [ ] just make the status bar more pelesent to look at and a bit usefull.

## Shell (zsh)
* All readey setup with all the things I want.
